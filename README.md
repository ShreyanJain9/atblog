# a simple blog on atproto

what's special about it? well, as far as i know it's the only one of its kind to use a proper lexicon format for its content. 
whitewind just throws everything into a markdown text field, and I think some other ones use blobs?

but here we have a custom (albeit as of yet undocumented) lexicon-based formatting approach, and it's not like facets either.
instead the formatting lives close to the content. sometime soon i hope to document this.
